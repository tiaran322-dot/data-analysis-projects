# 3) Write conditional expressions to satisfy the following safety rules:

# a) If crew_status is true, print "Crew Ready" else print "Crew Not Ready".


# b) If computer_status_code is 200, print "Please stand by. Computer is rebooting." Else if computer_status_code is 400, print "Success! Computer online." Else print "ALERT: Computer offline!"


# c) If shuttle_speed is > 17,500, print "ALERT: Escape velocity reached!" Else if shuttle_speed is < 8000, print "ALERT: Cannot maintain orbit!" Else print "Stable speed".


# 4) PREDICT: Do the code blocks shown in the Section D produce the same result?

# print("Yes" or "No")
