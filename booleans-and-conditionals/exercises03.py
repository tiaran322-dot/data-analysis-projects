# 5) Implement the following checks using if/else if/else statements:

# a) If fuel_level is above 20000 AND engine_temperature is at or below 2500, print "Full tank. Engines good."

# b) If fuel_level is above 10000 AND engine_temperature is at or below 2500, print "Fuel level above 50%.  Engines good."

# c) If fuel_level is above 5000 AND engine_temperature is at or below 2500, print "Fuel level above 25%. Engines good."

# d) If fuel_level is at or below 5000 OR engine_temperature is above 2500, print "Check fuel level. Engines running hot."

# e) If fuel_level is below 1000 OR engine_temperature is above 3500 OR engine_indicator_light is red blinking print "ENGINE FAILURE IMMINENT!" 

# f) Otherwise, print "Fuel and engine status pending..." 

# Code 5a - 5f here:



# 6) a) Create the variable command_override, and set it to be true or false. If command_override is false, then the shuttle should only launch if the fuel and engine check are OK. If command_override is true, then the shuttle will launch regardless of the fuel and engine status.


# 6) b) Code the following if/else check:

# If fuel_level is above 20000 AND engine_indicator_light is NOT red blinking OR command_override is true print "Cleared to launch!" Else print "Launch scrubbed!"
